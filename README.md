# TicTacToe-game

Tic-Tac-Toe ! Ya, you heard it, right. The game which we played a lot while we were children(during the lecture time ðŸ˜… ). Now, why don't you try out a new version of that? In this repo, you can find the code of modified version of Tic-Tac-Toe, this allows you to change the size of the board and total number of 'x' or 'o' in a continuous sequence to win the game.
